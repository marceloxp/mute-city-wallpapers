## Basic Prompt

```
This photograph captures a modern high-rise building at night, featuring a sleek, glass facade with numerous rectangular windows. The structure's design is characterized by a grid pattern and multiple levels, with lights illuminating the interior. Red, rectangular lights are placed at various points on the exterior, adding a touch of color against the dark, overcast sky. The building's sharp, angular lines and reflective surfaces give it a futuristic appearance. The overall ambiance is one of urban sophistication and modern architecture.
